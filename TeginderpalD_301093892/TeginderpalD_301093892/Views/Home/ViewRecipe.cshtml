        <h3>Simple Baked Chicken Breasts</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <span>Step : 1</span>
        <p>Preheat convection oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        <span>Step : 2</span>
        <p>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</p>
        <span>Step : 3</span>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</p>
        <span>Step : 4</span>
        <p>Remove chicken from pan. Pour water into the pan, while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add more water if needed to dislodge the browned bits; serve alongside chicken.</p>
